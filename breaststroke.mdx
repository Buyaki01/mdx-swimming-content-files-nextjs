- The stroke begins with the body in a stretched out, horizontal position with the face in the water
- The upper body lifts as the arms pull, and the head lifts to breathe
- Breaststroke leg kick takes place under the water and begins with the legs in an extended position with feet together
- The knees bend to bring the heels towards the butt, and the feet flex into an outward turned position simultaneously
-With the feet now turned outwards, they accelerate in a curved pathway, with the soles of the feet exposed to the water to provide propulsion
- The feet then snap together, and the legs finish together to form a streamlined shape
- The arms begin extended out front with palms facing downwards
- The arms then pull in a circular movement, outwards and downwards, followed by a movement inwards and forwards
- The hands finish together with extended arms and elbows tucked in to maintain a streamlined shape
-  Breathing inwards takes place every time the arms pull back to allow the body to lift and the head to rise
- Breathing outwards occurs as the legs kick back and the arms extend forwards - think 'blow your hands forwards'
- The coordination of the stroke can be broken down into a repeated pattern of 'pull, breathe, kick, glide'
