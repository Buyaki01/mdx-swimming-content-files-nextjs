- The body must be as horizontal and streamlined as possible, with the head inline, eyes looking upwards and remaining steady throughout
- The alternating leg kick originates from the hip and remains within the body width
- Toes are pointed with ankles relaxed, and the knees bend slightly with each kick
- The knee bend provides power on the upbeat phase of the kick, finishing as the toes break the water surface
- The hands enter the water with little-finger first, palm outwards with the upper arm just brushing past the ear
- The arm pulls through an S shape pathway, finishing at the hip, palm downwards
- One arm begins to pull as the other recovers over the water surface
- Breathing should be regular and in time with the effort phase of the stroke
- The leg kick and arm actions should be controlled and steady whilst maintaining a fixed head position
- All actions should be smooth, continuous and relaxed
