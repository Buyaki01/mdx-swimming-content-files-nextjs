It is also known as free style.
- The body must be kept horizontal, stretched and streamlined, with the face in the water and the eyes looking downwards and slightly forward

- The head leads the movement and only turns when a breath is taken
- The leg kick is a continuous movement originating at the hips and should be constant and alternating
- Toes must be pointed, ankles relaxed, and the knees bend slightly
- The feet make a small splash as they kick near the water surface
- The fingertips lead the hand entry, entering the water at a point in front of the head, between the shoulder and centre line
- The hand catches the water, palm down, and then accelerates through the hip's creating an S shape pathway
- The arm is taken back over the water in a pathway close to the body, with the head and near the water surface
- There should be a breath out into the water as the arm pulls through and the head rolls to the side ready to take a breath in
- Breathe inwards quickly as the arm recovers over the water surface, and the face rolls back into the water as the hand enters
- Each part of the stroke should complement each other whilst maintaining a balanced and streamlined body position
- All actions must be smooth and continuous
